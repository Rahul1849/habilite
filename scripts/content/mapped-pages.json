      "Question",
      "Who is Dr Kapil Agrawal?",
      "Answer",
      "Dr Kapil Agrawal is a highly qualified laparoscopic, laser & bariatric surgeon based in Delhi with over 23 years of experience, holding credentials including MBBS, MS (Surgery), MRCS (London, U.K.), MMED (Singapore), and FMAS.",
      "What kind of treatments does Dr Kapil Agrawal specialise in?",
      "He specialises in minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robotic) surgeries and laser treatments including gallbladder and hernia surgery, advanced bariatric and metabolic surgery, anorectal laser surgeries (for piles, fistula, fissure, pilonidal sinus), single-port and robot-assisted techniques.",
      "Where does he practise / where can I consult him?",
      "Dr Agrawal is senior consultant in the Department of Laparoscopic & Bariatric Surgery at the Apollo Group of Hospitals, New Delhi, and founder of Habilite Clinics (South Delhi, Green Park & Lajpat Nagar) where he offers consultations.",
      "How do I book an appointment?",
      "You can book a consultation with Dr Agrawal via Habilite Clinics' contact number, email, or enquiry form on the website, with tele-consultations (video/online) also available in many cases.",
      "Do you accept insurance and financing (EMI) options?",
      "Yes — major health insurance cash-less facilities are supported at his affiliated hospitals, and easy EMI / payment-plans are offered for selected surgical procedures.",
      "What are the benefits of minimally invasive / laser surgery under Dr Agrawal?",
      "Minimally invasive and laser techniques offer smaller incisions, less pain, quicker recovery, minimal scarring, faster return to work and normal life — all of which Dr Agrawal emphasises in his practice.",
      "Is single-port laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery available?",
      "Yes. Dr Agrawal offers single-port laparoscopic and robot-assisted techniques for suitable cases (for example gallbladder surgery, hernia, bariatric surgery) to maximise cosmetic and recovery advantages.",
      "What kinds of weight loss / bariatric treatments are offered?",
      "He offers a full range: sleeve gastrectomy, mini gastric bypass, Roux-en-Y bypass, revisional bariatric surgery, as well as non-surgical treatments like intragastric balloons (Allurion, Spatz) plus medically supervised weight-management programmes.",
      "What should I bring / how should I prepare for the first consultation?",
      "Bring previous imaging/reports (if any), list of current medications, any existing comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension). The consultation will include clinical evaluation, discussion of treatment options, expected outcomes and costs. Prepare questions in advance about risks, recovery time, and expected results.",
      "Post-surgery care: what is the typical recovery & follow-up like?",
      "Recovery and follow-up depend on the specific procedure. Minimally invasive surgeries typically lead to shorter hospital stays, faster mobilisation and fewer complications. A follow-up plan will be provided including wound check-ups, diet and lifestyle advice, and long-term surveillance if needed.",
      "Are international patients / tele-consultations catered to?",
      "Yes — Habilite Clinics supports international patients and online consultations. Dr Agrawal and his team coordinate care, treatment planning, and post-operative follow-up for patients coming from abroad.",
      "How do I know if I need surgery or a less invasive option?",
      "During the consultation, Dr Agrawal will assess your condition (symptoms, investigations, overall health) and advise whether surgery is the best option or if a conservative, non-surgical treatment may suffice. The decision will be personalised based on your health, lifestyle, and goals.",

      "Question",
      "What causes hernia?",
      "Answer",
      "Hernias occur when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in surrounding muscle or connective tissue. Common causes include congenital weakness, heavy lifting, chronic coughing, obesity, pregnancy, and previous surgeries.",
      "Is hernia surgery the only treatment?",
      "Surgery is the only definitive treatment for hernias. Small, asymptomatic hernias may be monitored, but symptomatic or enlarging hernias require surgical repair to prevent complications like strangulation or obstruction.",
      "Can a hernia heal on its own?",
      "No, hernias cannot heal on their own. The muscle wall defect will not repair itself. Surgery is necessary to fix the weakened area and prevent the hernia from enlarging or causing complications.",
      "Is it safe to leave a hernia untreated?",
      "While small, asymptomatic hernias can sometimes be monitored, leaving a symptomatic or enlarging hernia untreated can be dangerous. It may lead to strangulation (cutting off blood supply) or obstruction, which are medical emergencies.",
      "What activities should be avoided if you have a hernia?",
      "Avoid heavy lifting, straining during bowel movements, chronic coughing, and activities that increase abdominal pressure. Maintain a healthy weight, eat high-fiber foods to prevent constipation, and avoid smoking.",
      "How long is recovery after hernia surgery?",
      "Most patients recover within 1-2 weeks after laparoscopic hernia surgery. You can return to normal activities within a few days, with full recovery typically taking 2-4 weeks. Dr. Kapil Agrawal provides personalized recovery guidance for each patient.",
      "What are the symptoms of hernia?",
      "Common symptoms include visible bulge in abdomen or groin, pain or discomfort in the affected area, heaviness or pressure sensation, pain that worsens with activity, and difficulty reducing the bulge.",
      "When is hernia surgery necessary?",
      "Surgery is necessary when the hernia causes pain, is enlarging, becomes irreducible, or shows signs of strangulation. Dr. Kapil Agrawal evaluates each case individually to determine the best treatment approach.",
      "HowTo",
      "How to Check for Hernia Symptoms - 30 Second Self-Check",
      "A simple 30-second self-check guide to identify potential hernia symptoms. If two or more symptoms apply, consult with Dr. Kapil Agrawals hernia care team.",

      "Question",
      "What causes gallbladder stones?",
      "Answer",
      "Gallbladder stones (gallstones) form when bile contains too much cholesterol, bilirubin, or not enough bile salts to keep these substances dissolved. Factors include high-fat diets, rapid weight loss, obesity, genetics, and certain medical conditions.",
      "Is gallbladder surgery the only treatment?",
      "Surgery (cholecystectomy) is the only definitive cure for symptomatic gallstones. Medicines may temporarily manage pain or acidity but do not remove stones. Non-surgical options are limited to select cases and often have high recurrence rates.",
      "Can I dissolve gallstones naturally?",
      "There are no proven natural remedies that reliably dissolve gallstones. Some medications can dissolve small cholesterol stones, but they work slowly and stones frequently recur. Medical evaluation is essential before trying any therapy.",
      "Is it safe to leave gallstones untreated?",
      "Silent stones can sometimes be monitored, but once they cause pain, infection, or pancreatitis, leaving them untreated can be dangerous. Untreated symptomatic stones may lead to recurrent attacks or emergencies.",
      "What foods should be avoided if you have gallstones?",
      "Limit fried foods, high-fat dairy, red meat, processed snacks, and sugary desserts. Choose smaller meals, lean proteins, fibre-rich foods, and stay hydrated to reduce gallbladder stress.",
      "How long is recovery after gallbladder surgery?",
      "Most patients recover within 1-2 weeks after laparoscopic gallbladder surgery. You can return to normal activities within a few days, with full recovery typically taking 2-4 weeks. Dr. Kapil Agrawal provides personalized recovery guidance for each patient.",
      "What are the symptoms of gallbladder stones?",
      "Common symptoms include pain on the right side of upper stomach, pain after oily/spicy meals, nausea or vomiting, bloating or indigestion, back or shoulder pain, fever with pain, and pain lasting more than 30-60 minutes.",
      "When is gallbladder surgery necessary?",
      "Surgery is necessary when stones cause pain, pain has repeated more than twice, stones are larger than 10 mm, gallbladder wall is thick on ultrasound, or there is sludge or infection noted. Dr. Kapil Agrawal evaluates each case individually.",
      "HowTo",
      "How to Check for Gallbladder Stone Symptoms - 30 Second Self-Check",

      "What causes gallbladder stones?",
      "Gallbladder stones (gallstones) form when bile contains too much cholesterol, bilirubin, or not enough bile salts to keep these substances dissolved. Factors include high-fat diets, rapid weight loss, obesity, genetics, and certain medical conditions.",
      "Is gallbladder surgery the only treatment?",
      "Surgery (cholecystectomy) is the only definitive cure for symptomatic gallstones. Medicines may temporarily manage pain or acidity but do not remove stones. Non-surgical options are limited to select cases and often have high recurrence rates.",
      "Can I dissolve gallstones naturally?",
      "There are no proven natural remedies that reliably dissolve gallstones. Some medications can dissolve small cholesterol stones, but they work slowly and stones frequently recur. Medical evaluation is essential before trying any therapy.",
      "Is it safe to leave gallstones untreated?",
      "Silent stones can sometimes be monitored, but once they cause pain, infection, or pancreatitis, leaving them untreated can be dangerous. Untreated symptomatic stones may lead to recurrent attacks or emergencies.",
      "What foods should be avoided if you have gallstones?",
      "Limit fried foods, high-fat dairy, red meat, processed snacks, and sugary desserts. Choose smaller meals, lean proteins, fibre-rich foods, and stay hydrated to reduce gallbladder stress.",

      "How effective is your program in causing weight loss?",
      "The effectiveness of the program depends upon your motivational levels and the commitment to follow the advice of our physician and nutritionists. Majority of our patients lose 1-2 kgs per week during the initial phase with an average weight loss of 12-15 kgs over a period of 5-6 months. It is important to stay in a monitored weight loss program to maintain the lost weight.",
      "Are any drugs or appetite suppressants used in your program?",
      "The use of drugs for weight loss is strictly under the domain of bariatric physician. However, we try to restrict the use of drugs as much as possible. Most of the drugs used are appetite suppressants and are used for a little period of time.",
      "What is the best way to diet?",
      "The best way to diet is to make some permanent lifestyle changes that incorporate increased activity, dietary changes and behavior strategies. One should never opt for crash diets causing sudden weight loss and keep a realistic expectation about weight loss through diet and exercise.",
      "How important is portion size?",
      "It is very important to understand portion size for a successful weight management plan. If we don’t have any knowledge about portion size or the amount of calories we are consuming, we cannot achieve a good weight loss.",
      "Is exercise a part of the program and how important is it for weight loss?",
      "Exercise is a very vital part of our weight loss program. It helps in maintaining your muscle mass and even helps to maintain your weight loss. There is no fitness center located at our clinic but we have trained exercise physiologists to set goals and start an exercise program to meet your needs and goals.",
      "Do you have any special program for children?",
      "We do have a special program designed for overweight children between the ages of 7 and 12, and their families. We help these children achieve a healthier lifestyle and weight through behavior modification, changes in diet and physical activity.",

      "Question",
      "Can lipomas be dangerous?",
      "Answer",
      "Lipomas are generally not dangerous. However, lipomas that are rapidly growing must be removed immediately and sent for biopsy to assess if they are cancerous. If the lipomas are small and not increasing in size, they are usually harmless.",
      "How do you treat a lipoma without surgery?",
      "Lipomas usually require some form of surgical intervention for permanent results. However, very small and soft lipomas can be treated with the instillation of steroid injections directly into lipomas. High recurrence rates are associated with this procedure.",
      "Can lipomas be treated with ayurvedic medicines?",
      "The role of ayurvedic medicines is highly controversial in managing lipomas, especially multiple and large in size.",
      "Can lipomas grow back at the same site?",
      "Proper and completely excised lipomas do not grow back in the same place. Lipomas that are large or hard in consistency when removed by liposuction can result in incomplete removal of lipomas, resulting in recurrence.",
      "At what size should lipoma be reduced?",
      "The decision to remove lipomas generally depends upon the symptoms and the progression of lipoma. Lipomas that are increasing in size should be removed immediately. However, lipomas over 3cm in length should be removed for cosmetic purposes.",
      "How to cure lipoma by exercise?",
      "Once formed, lipomas cannot be cured by exercise. However, maintaining a healthy weight is always beneficial in managing lipomas. It has been seen that maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the further formation of lipomas in a few individuals.",
      "Can lipoma cream be used for lipoma removal?",
      "Lipoma cream can never remove or dissolve lipomas. It can only help to relieve pain, discomfort, or irritation caused by lipoma. One should never buy these creams to remove lipomas as these creams are ineffective in curing lipomas.",
      "How to stop lipoma from spreading?",
      "There is no definitive way to prevent the spreading of lipoma, especially for patients with a genetic predisposition. However, maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle definitely reduces the formation of lipomas. A healthy diet and less use of junk foods also help to detoxify the body and prevent the further formation of lipomas.",
      "Can lipomas dissolve on their own?",
      "Lipomas can never disappear on their own. However, significantly reducing weight and maintaining a healthy lifestyle might reduce the size of lipomas to a certain extent.",
      "What are the special diets to prevent the spreading of lipoma?",
      "Certain fruits, like blueberries, raspberries, citrus fruits, apples, plums, etc., help detoxify the body and reduce the chances of lipoma formation. Green leafy vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids also decrease inflammation and growth of lipomas.",

      "How long is the procedure?",
      "The time taken for surgery depends upon the complexity of the pilonidal sinus. The approximate duration of surgery is between 45 minutes to two hours.",
      "What is the duration of stay in the hospital?",
      "We usually discharge the patients on the same day or the next day of surgery.",
      "Can pilonidal sinus be cured by medicine or conservative methods?",
      "The pilonidal sinus can be cured by medicines and certain lifestyle modifications in the very initial stages. However, as the disease progresses, it becomes challenging to treat the condition with drugs.",
      "What are the chances of recurrence?",
      "Simple Pilonidal disease can be cured with almost zero recurrences, but in complex cases associated with multiple and extensive branching, there are chances of recurrence. The best ways to minimize recurrence are: Early intervention, Experience and expertise of the surgeon, and Choosing the right option for treatment.",
      "When can I join my duties?",
      "The majority of our patients can join back their work in five to seven days post-surgery. It all depends on the pilonidal sinus disease complexity and the type of procedure chosen to deal with it.",
      "Do I need to come for a follow-up?",
      "The majority of the patients don&apos;t require any follow-ups. But some of the patients might require irrigation of wounds 2-3 times. We have specialized dressers who can visit your house. They will clean and rinse the wound or tell you how you can rinse the track at home.",
      "What can I expect from your team?",
      "Extreme confidentiality, strict adherence to international guidelines, highly experienced and internationally trained team, complete range of all the best treatment modalities, world best quality, highly advanced, USFDA approved 1470 nm Laser Machines, honest opinion and detailed discussion about the best modality for you, customized treatment plans, and personalized care and direct doctor-patient relationship without the involvement of third-party or companies.",
      "What is the best treatment for pilonidal sinus?",
      "The best treatment for pilonidal sinus depends upon several factors: Whether the fistula is a simple type or complex type, whether it is a recurrence or a fresh fistula, and whether there are significant branching or ramifications. Our team has all the best and latest available options for the treatment of all types of fistula.",
      "What is SiLaC procedure for pilonidal sinus?",
      "SiLaC (Pilonidal Sinus Laser Assisted Closure) is done for simple, single-track pilonidal disease. After cleaning and thorough irrigation of the tract, laser emitting laser fiber is inserted into the track, and a defined amount of energy is delivered. This energy causes thermal ablation and collapse of the tract.",
      "What is LA-EPSIT procedure?",
      "Laser Assisted EPSIT Procedure uses a highly sophisticated, skinny endoscopic camera introduced into the sinus to remove all debris and small tuft of hairs under direct vision. The tract is then ablated with the help of laser emitting radial fiber through a photocoagulation mechanism.",
      "What are flap-based repairs for pilonidal sinus?",
      "In highly complex or recurrent pilonidal disease, flap-based repairs are advised. Cleft Lift Repair is usually indicated for patients having deep natal cleft anatomy. Limberg Flap Repair is indicated for patients having extensive disease involving both buttocks.",
      "What are the advantages of laser treatment for pilonidal sinus?",
      "Laser treatment for pilonidal sinus offers minimal invasiveness, speedy recovery, same-day discharge, minimal post-operative follow-ups or dressings, and almost negligible recurrence rates. The wound healing is swift because of its minimally invasive nature.",
      "What causes pilonidal sinus?",
      "Common causes include positive family history of the disease, obesity, poor hygiene, deep natal cleft anatomy, hirsutism or excessive hair in the natal cleft, occupation requiring prolonged sitting like drivers (also known as Jeep disease), and excessive sweating.",
      "What is the cost of pilonidal sinus surgery in Delhi?",
      "The cost of pilonidal sinus surgery in Delhi ranges from ₹50,000 to ₹1,50,000, depending on the complexity of the disease, the procedure chosen (laser, SiLaC, LA-EPSIT, or flap-based repair), and the hospital facilities. Insurance coverage and EMI options are available at Habilite Clinics.",
      "Is pilonidal sinus surgery painful?",
      "With modern laser techniques, pilonidal sinus surgery is much less painful than traditional methods. Most patients experience minimal discomfort and can manage pain with prescribed medications. Recovery is generally faster with laser procedures.",

      "Can lipomas be dangerous?",
      "Answer",
      "Lipomas are generally not dangerous. However, rapidly growing lipomas must be removed immediately and sent for biopsy to rule out cancer.",
      "What are the best treatment options for lipoma?",
      "Depending on size, depth, and location, options include observation, liposuction-assisted removal, pinch technique, laser, and surgical excision. Treatment is customised for each patient.",
      "Do lipomas grow back after removal?",
      "Properly and completely excised lipomas do not grow back in the same place. Recurrence is usually due to incomplete removal.",
      "Can exercise or diet dissolve lipomas?",
      "Lipomas never disappear on their own. A healthy lifestyle may slow the formation of new lipomas but surgical removal is the definitive treatment.",
      "What is the recovery time after lipoma removal?",
      "Most minimally invasive procedures allow patients to resume daily activities within 1-2 days. Large or deep lipomas may require 5-7 days of downtime.",

      "Can lipomas be dangerous?",
      "Lipomas are generally not dangerous. However, lipomas that are rapidly growing must be removed immediately and sent for biopsy to assess if they are cancerous. If the lipomas are small and not increasing in size, they are usually harmless.",
      "How do you treat a lipoma without surgery?",
      "Lipomas usually require some form of surgical intervention for permanent results. However, very small and soft lipomas can be treated with the instillation of steroid injections directly into lipomas. High recurrence rates are associated with this procedure.",
      "Can lipomas be treated with ayurvedic medicines?",
      "The role of ayurvedic medicines is highly controversial in managing lipomas, especially multiple and large ones. There is no clinical evidence that these medicines can shrink or remove lipomas permanently.",
      "Can lipomas grow back at the same site?",
      "Properly and completely excised lipomas do not grow back in the same place. Lipomas that are large or hard in consistency when removed by liposuction can result in incomplete removal, leading to recurrence.",
      "At what size should a lipoma be removed?",
      "The decision to remove lipomas generally depends upon the symptoms and the progression of lipoma. Lipomas that are increasing in size or causing cosmetic concerns should be removed immediately. Lipomas over 3 cm in length are usually removed even if they are painless.",
      "Can exercise cure lipomas?",
      "Once formed, lipomas cannot be cured by exercise. However, maintaining a healthy weight is beneficial in managing lipomas and may reduce the formation of new lipomas in a few individuals.",
      "Do lipoma creams work?",
      "Lipoma creams cannot remove or dissolve lipomas. They might provide temporary relief from irritation but are ineffective in curing lipomas.",
      "How can I stop lipomas from spreading?",
      "There is no definitive way to prevent the spreading of lipomas, especially for patients with a genetic predisposition. Maintaining a healthy weight, following a balanced diet, and reducing junk food intake may slow down the development of new lipomas.",
      "Can lipomas dissolve on their own?",
      "Lipomas never disappear on their own. Significant weight reduction and a healthy lifestyle might reduce the size of lipomas to some extent, but surgical removal is the only definitive treatment.",
      "What type of diet helps prevent lipomas?",
      "Fruits like blueberries, raspberries, citrus fruits, apples, and plums help detoxify the body. Green leafy vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids may also decrease inflammation and the growth of lipomas.",
      "What are the best treatment options for lipomas?",
      "Depending on the size, depth, and location, treatment options include observation, liposuction-assisted removal, pinch technique, surgical excision, and steroid injections for very small lipomas. Dr. Kapil Agrawal customizes the plan based on each patient’s needs.",
      "What is the recovery time after lipoma removal?",
      "Most minimally invasive procedures such as the pinch technique allow patients to resume daily activities within 1-2 days. Larger or deep lipomas that need traditional excision might require a slightly longer downtime of 5-7 days.",

      "What are the potential complications associated with untreated Piles?",
      "Some of the potential complications include: Sometimes, blood clots form within a haemorrhoid, causing severe pain and swelling. This is known as thrombosed piles. Chronic blood loss from piles can lead to anaemia, characterized by fatigue and weakness. Strangulated haemorrhoids is an extremely painful condition which can occur due to loss of blood supply to piles mass. This condition requires urgent surgical intervention.",
      "What is the best treatment for piles?",
      "The best treatment of piles depends upon the grade and stage of piles. While very early stages can be managed with the help of medicines and certain precautions, grades II and III are best managed with the help of laser surgeries. Grade IV haemorrhoids are usually treated by stapler surgery for piles. Open surgeries best manage complicated piles or excessively prolapsed piles.",
      "What are the chances of recurrence after laser surgery of piles?",
      "The chances of recurrence after laser surgery for piles are usually 4-5%. However, recurrences can be prevented by using high-quality laser machines, properly indicating the procedure, and avoiding constipation after surgery.",
      "Can piles be treated with medicines?",
      "Piles can never be cured with medicines. However, medicines can delay the progression of disease or can help in providing symptomatic relief to the patients for some time. You must always seek the opinion of a specialist surgeon who can advise you on the best course of treatment.",
      "What early surgical intervention for piles is better?",
      "Piles is a slowly progressive disease, and it is always better to treat piles when they are grade II or grade III. This is because these types of piles can be treated with laser, which is almost a painless procedure. If the piles progress to grade IV or develop complications, they may require open surgeries, which are quite painless during the initial days post-surgery.",
      "How is the course of recovery after laser piles surgery?",
      "Laser surgery for piles is known for its quick recovery and minimal discomfort. Patients are typically discharged within 24 hours of the procedure and can resume normal activities within four to five days. Laser surgery doesn&apos;t require bed rest or post-operative dressings.",
      "Is laser treatment safe for piles?",
      "Laser surgery is a highly safe procedure for the management of piles. The excellent quality laser machines are USFDA-approved and do not produce any side effects. However, it would be best if you considered the following facts before opting for the treatment: Experience and Expertise of surgeon, Grade and stage of piles, Quality of laser machines and fibres.",
      "Does the quality of laser machines affect surgical outcomes?",
      "The quality of laser machines significantly affects surgical outcomes. Low-quality laser machines can lead to complications such as thermal burns. Even the likelihood of recurrence or piles returning is much higher than procedures performed with high-quality machines.",
      "Which type of doctor is best for piles?",
      "A colorectal surgeon or a general surgeon with experience in anorectal conditions is best for treating piles.",
      "Which is the best surgery for piles?",
      "Laser surgery is one of the best and most advanced options. It is painless, minimally invasive, and offers faster recovery.",
      "What is the cost of piles surgery?",
      "The cost of piles surgery in India ranges from ₹30,000 to ₹90,000, depending on the procedure and hospital.",
      "Is piles surgery risky?",
      "Modern piles surgeries like laser and stapler methods are safe and have minimal risks when done by experienced surgeons.",
      "What are stage 4 hemorrhoids?",
      "Stage 4 hemorrhoids are severely prolapsed and remain outside the anus. They often require surgical treatment.",
      "What size of piles need surgery?",
      "Large or prolapsed piles (Grade 3 or 4) that cause bleeding, pain, or discomfort usually require surgery.",
      "Is piles surgery very painful?",
      "Not anymore. With advanced methods like laser and stapler surgery, pain is minimal and recovery is quick.",
      "How to remove piles without surgery?",
      "Early-stage piles can be managed with diet changes, medicines, lifestyle modifications, and topical treatments.",
      "Can piles be 100% cured?",
      "Yes, piles can be effectively cured with proper treatment. Surgery offers the best chance for permanent relief.",
      "Can piles come again after surgery?",
      "Recurrence is rare with proper surgical technique and post-op care, but it can happen if lifestyle isn&apos;t improved.",
      "What are grade 3 piles?",
      "Grade 3 piles prolapse during bowel movements and need to be pushed back manually. Surgery is usually recommended.",
      "Can I sit after piles surgery?",
      "Yes, you can sit after piles surgery, though initially, you may need a soft cushion for comfort.",
      "Which stage of piles need surgery?",

      "Can newborns undergo stapler circumcision?",
      "Yes. ZSR staplers come in multiple sizes and are completely safe for neonates and children. The procedure is performed under short general anesthesia and the child is discharged the same day.",
      "Can I get ZSR circumcision if the foreskin is infected?",
      "ZSR circumcision can be performed even in infected foreskin with excellent results. Your surgeon may prescribe a longer course of antibiotics to clear infection before and after the procedure.",
      "Do I need to visit the clinic to remove the silicone ring?",
      "In 99% cases the silicone ring falls off on its own within 4–5 days after healing. Only 1% patients require the surgeon to remove the ring manually.",
      "Does circumcision affect sexual drive or performance?",
      "Circumcision has a very modest effect on sexual performance. Libido and performance are influenced by many physiological and psychological factors.",
      "Is circumcision covered under insurance?",
      "Yes. Almost all insurance companies cover circumcision. Habilite Clinics partners with leading hospitals in Delhi-NCR to provide seamless cashless options.",
      "Is stapler circumcision painful?",
      "The ZSR stapler technique is almost painless. Patients are comfortable after the procedure and can resume normal activities from the next day.",
      "Does circumcision change penis size or sensitivity?",
      "Circumcision does not change penis size. Sensitivity differences are minimal and vary from person to person. Studies show no significant effect on fertility or sperm production.",
      "Which circumcision technique is best?",
      "Laser and stapler (ZSR) circumcision are the most advanced options. They are bloodless, stitchless, painless, and allow same-day discharge with faster healing than conventional surgery.",
      "What are the main benefits of male circumcision?",
      "Improved penile hygiene and a protective effect against infections such as HIV, genital herpes, and human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV reduction lowers the risk of penile and cervical cancers.",
      "How much does stapler circumcision cost in Delhi?",
      "The average cost ranges between ₹30,000 and ₹40,000 depending on the hospital, anesthesia, and device quality. Habilite Clinics can complete the procedure for approximately ₹20,000 with package pricing and EMI support.",

      "What is an anal fistula?",
      "An anal fistula is an abnormal tunnel-like connection between the anal canal and the skin around the anus. It usually develops after an anal abscess that has not healed properly. The fistula allows pus and other fluids to drain from the infected area.",
      "What causes anal fistula?",
      "Anal fistulas most commonly develop from an anal abscess that has not healed completely. Other causes include Crohn&apos;s disease, trauma, radiation therapy, tuberculosis, or sexually transmitted infections. In some cases, they can occur without a clear cause.",
      "What are the symptoms of anal fistula?",
      "Common symptoms include persistent drainage of pus or blood from an opening near the anus, pain and swelling around the anus, irritation of the skin around the anus, pain during bowel movements, fever and chills (if there is an active infection), and a visible opening or bump near the anus.",
      "How is anal fistula diagnosed?",
      "Diagnosis typically involves a physical examination, where the doctor looks for an external opening and may gently probe the area. Additional tests may include an MRI or CT scan to visualize the fistula tract, an ultrasound to assess the extent of the fistula, or an examination under anesthesia to better evaluate the fistula.",
      "What is laser anal fistula treatment?",
      "Laser anal fistula treatment uses focused laser energy to seal and close the fistula tract. This minimally invasive procedure causes minimal damage to surrounding tissues, reduces pain, and promotes faster healing compared to traditional surgery.",
      "What is VAAFT technology for anal fistula?",
      "VAAFT (Video-Assisted Anal Fistula Treatment) is an advanced endoscopic procedure that allows the surgeon to visualize the entire fistula tract using a small camera. The fistula is then cleaned and treated from the inside, preserving sphincter function and reducing the risk of incontinence.",
      "Is anal fistula surgery painful?",
      "With modern techniques like laser and VAAFT, anal fistula surgery is much less painful than traditional methods. Most patients experience minimal discomfort and can manage pain with prescribed medications. Recovery is generally faster with these advanced techniques.",
      "What is the recovery time after anal fistula surgery?",
      "Recovery time varies depending on the procedure. With laser and VAAFT treatments, most patients can resume normal activities within 1-2 weeks. Complete healing typically takes 4-6 weeks. Traditional surgery may require a longer recovery period.",
      "Can anal fistula recur after treatment?",
      "Recurrence rates depend on the type of treatment and the complexity of the fistula. Laser and VAAFT procedures have lower recurrence rates (typically 5-10%) compared to traditional surgery. Following post-operative care instructions and maintaining good hygiene can help prevent recurrence.",
      "What are the risks of anal fistula surgery?",
      "Potential risks include recurrence of the fistula, temporary or permanent incontinence (rare with modern techniques), infection, bleeding, and scarring. However, with experienced surgeons using advanced techniques like laser and VAAFT, these risks are significantly minimized.",
      "Can anal fistula be treated without surgery?",
      "In very rare cases, simple fistulas may heal with antibiotics and proper wound care, but most anal fistulas require surgical treatment. Non-surgical treatments are generally not effective for complete healing and may lead to complications.",
      "What is the cost of anal fistula surgery in Delhi?",
      "The cost of anal fistula surgery in Delhi ranges from ₹40,000 to ₹1,20,000, depending on the complexity of the fistula, the procedure chosen (laser, VAAFT, or traditional), and the hospital facilities. Insurance coverage and EMI options are available at Habilite Clinics.",
      "How long does anal fistula surgery take?",
      "The duration depends on the complexity of the fistula. Simple fistulas treated with laser may take 30-45 minutes, while complex fistulas requiring VAAFT may take 1-2 hours. The procedure is typically performed under general or spinal anesthesia.",
      "What should I expect after anal fistula surgery?",
      "After surgery, you may experience some discomfort and drainage for a few days. You&apos;ll need to keep the area clean, take prescribed medications, and follow dietary recommendations. Most patients can return to work within 1-2 weeks, depending on their job requirements.",
      "Can I prevent anal fistula?",
      "While not all fistulas can be prevented, maintaining good anal hygiene, treating anal abscesses promptly, managing underlying conditions like Crohn&apos;s disease, and avoiding constipation can help reduce the risk of developing anal fistulas.",

      "What is an anal fissure?",
      "An anal fissure is a small tear or cut in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. It typically causes pain and bleeding during bowel movements. Anal fissures are common and can affect people of all ages.",
      "What causes anal fissure?",
      "Common causes include passing hard or large stools during bowel movements, chronic constipation or diarrhea, straining during bowel movements, childbirth, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), decreased blood flow to the anorectal area, and anal intercourse.",
      "What are the symptoms of anal fissure?",
      "Symptoms include sharp, severe pain during and after bowel movements that can last for several hours, bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement, a visible crack or tear in the skin around the anus, a small lump or skin tag near the anal fissure, and burning or itching sensation in the anal area.",
      "Can anal fissure be treated without surgery?",
      "Yes, many anal fissures can be treated with non-surgical methods including high-fiber diet, increased fluid intake, stool softeners, topical medications (nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers), warm sitz baths, and lifestyle modifications. However, chronic fissures may require surgical intervention.",
      "What is Botox treatment for anal fissure?",
      "Botox (botulinum toxin) injections can help relax the anal sphincter muscle, reducing spasms and allowing the fissure to heal. This is a non-surgical treatment option that can be effective for chronic anal fissures that haven&apos;t responded to conservative treatments.",
      "What is laser surgery for anal fissure?",
      "Laser surgery for anal fissure uses focused laser energy to precisely treat the fissure and relax the anal sphincter. This minimally invasive procedure causes minimal tissue damage, reduces pain, and promotes faster healing compared to traditional surgery.",
      "Is anal fissure surgery painful?",
      "With modern laser techniques, anal fissure surgery is much less painful than traditional methods. Most patients experience minimal discomfort and can manage pain with prescribed medications. Recovery is generally faster with laser procedures.",
      "What is the recovery time after anal fissure surgery?",
      "Recovery time varies depending on the procedure. With laser treatment, most patients can resume normal activities within a few days. Complete healing typically takes 2-4 weeks. Traditional surgery may require a longer recovery period.",
      "Can anal fissure recur after treatment?",
      "Recurrence is possible but less common with proper treatment and preventive measures. Following a high-fiber diet, staying hydrated, avoiding constipation, and maintaining good anal hygiene can help prevent recurrence.",
      "What are the risks of anal fissure surgery?",
      "Potential risks include temporary or permanent incontinence (rare with modern techniques), infection, bleeding, scarring, and recurrence. However, with experienced surgeons using advanced techniques like laser, these risks are significantly minimized.",
      "How long does anal fissure surgery take?",
      "The duration depends on the procedure. Laser anal fissure surgery typically takes 15-30 minutes. The procedure is usually performed under local or general anesthesia.",
      "What should I expect after anal fissure surgery?",
      "After surgery, you may experience some discomfort and mild bleeding for a few days. You&apos;ll need to keep the area clean, take prescribed medications, follow dietary recommendations, and avoid straining during bowel movements. Most patients can return to work within a few days.",
      "What is the cost of anal fissure surgery in Delhi?",
      "The cost of anal fissure surgery in Delhi ranges from ₹25,000 to ₹80,000, depending on the procedure chosen (non-surgical, Botox, laser, or traditional surgery) and the hospital facilities. Insurance coverage and EMI options are available at Habilite Clinics.",
      "Can I prevent anal fissure?",
      "Yes, you can reduce the risk by maintaining a high-fiber diet, drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding straining during bowel movements, treating constipation promptly, and maintaining good anal hygiene. Regular exercise can also help prevent constipation.",
      "What is the difference between acute and chronic anal fissure?",
      "An acute anal fissure is a recent tear that typically heals within 4-6 weeks with conservative treatment. A chronic anal fissure persists for more than 6-8 weeks and may require surgical intervention. Chronic fissures often have exposed muscle fibers and may develop a sentinel pile (skin tag).",

      "How long do I stay in the hospital after laparoscopic hernia repair?",
      "Most patients are discharged on the same day or within 24 hours and can walk normally immediately after surgery.",
      "Can a hernia heal on its own?",
      "No. A hernia is a progressive gap in the muscle wall and never heals spontaneously. Surgery is the only permanent treatment.",
      "Which technique is better – open, laparoscopic, or robotic?",
      "Laparoscopic and robotic repairs are preferred for most hernias because they are painless, cause minimal scarring, and allow faster return to work. Open surgery is reserved for very large or complex cases.",
      "Is hernia surgery covered by insurance in India?",
      "Yes. Most health insurance policies cover hernia surgery. Habilite Clinics provides complete cashless coordination and EMI support.",
      "What is the recovery time for hernia surgery?",
      "Desk work usually resumes in 7-10 days after laparoscopic repair, while heavy physical work may require 3-4 weeks of rest.",

      "Depending on the site, technique, and hospital, the cost ranges between ₹50,000 and ₹1.5 lakh. Robotic abdominal wall reconstruction may cost more.",

      "Physical examination is usually sufficient. Ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI are advised for complex or recurrent hernias.",

      "What is Gallbladder?",
      "The gallbladder is a tiny pear-shaped organ located just below the liver. It is situated on the right upper side of the belly. The liver produces a yellow-coloured fluid known as BILE. This bile flows into the intestine and helps digest foods, especially fatty meals.",

      "flex items-start",
      "text-[#0891b2] mr-2 mt-1 flex-shrink-0",
      "Storage of Bile:",
      "The liver produces 1.5 litres of bile daily. Most of the bile goes directly into the food pipe or intestine. Nevertheless, 50 ml of bile goes into the gallbladder and is stored as an emergency reserve.",
      "Bile Release:",
      "As soon as fatty foods or numerous large meals enter the small intestine, the gallbladder starts releasing bile so that food can be digested properly.",
      "What Are Gallstones (Cholelithiasis)?",
      "Gallstones are solid particles that develop in the gallbladder—a small organ located beneath the liver. The gallbladder stores and releases a digestive fluid, named bile produced by the liver. Bile helps to break down food ingested and also transmits waste products like cholesterol and bilirubin, which are created from the breakdown of red blood cells. Sometimes, these substances can harden and form gallstones of varied sizes. Gallstones have a tendency to block bile duct; they can cause intense pain and may need instant medical intervention.",
      "Symptoms of Gallbladder Stones",
      "According to Dr. Kapil Agrawal, the best doctor for gallbladder surgery, there are no noticeable symptoms of gallstones in many cases. When small stones restrict flow of bile juice, they can result in biliary colic—identified by sudden upper abdominal pain, nausea, and digestive discomfort.",
      "bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 rounded-lg p-6 mb-4",
      "Few identifying symptoms are as follows:",

      "Pain can be in the right upper abdomen, central referred to back or general all over the abdomen.",
      "Nausea or Vomiting:",
      "These symptoms can be generated as the stones block the ducts.",
      "Bloating of the Abdomen:",
      "Gallstones can result in symptoms like indigestion that further led to formation and accumulation of gases in your intestines, resulting in abdominal bloating.",
      "Jaundice:",
      "A yellowish tinge in your eyes and urine, which occurs when stones outflow from the gallbladder into main ducts, blocking bile flow.",
      "High-grade Fever with Chills:",
      "Fever and shivers or chills may be a sign of infection in the gallbladder including that in either central bile duct.",
      "Why do Gallstones Form?",

      "Metabolic Disturbances",
      "Changes in cholesterol metabolism (Hyperlipidemia) - due to obesity, rapid gain or loss of weight.",
      "Infection of the Gallbladder",

      "Answer",
      "Gallbladder polyps are abnormal tissue growths on the inner wall of the gallbladder. They are quite common, and most of these polyps are harmless (non-cancerous). However, larger polyps may require monitoring or surgical removal.",
      "Do all gallbladder polyps need surgery?",
      "No, not all gallbladder polyps require surgical intervention. Small polyps (less than 10mm) are usually monitored regularly. Polyps larger than 10mm or those showing signs of growth may require gallbladder removal due to cancer risk.",
      "What size of gallbladder polyp is dangerous?",
      "Polyps larger than 10mm are considered higher risk and may require surgical removal. Polyps between 6-10mm are monitored closely, while those smaller than 6mm are usually benign and monitored periodically.",
      "Can gallbladder polyps become cancerous?",
      "Most gallbladder polyps are benign. However, larger polyps (especially those over 10mm) have a higher risk of being cancerous or becoming cancerous over time, which is why they may require surgical removal.",

      "What are gallbladder polyps?",
      "Gallbladder polyps are abnormal tissue growths on the inner wall of the gallbladder. They are quite common, and most of these polyps are harmless (non-cancerous). However, larger polyps may require monitoring or surgical removal.",
      "Do all gallbladder polyps need surgery?",
      "No, not all gallbladder polyps require surgical intervention. Small polyps (less than 10mm) are usually monitored regularly. Polyps larger than 10mm or those showing signs of growth may require gallbladder removal due to cancer risk.",
      "What size of gallbladder polyp is dangerous?",
      "Polyps larger than 10mm are considered higher risk and may require surgical removal. Polyps between 6-10mm are monitored closely, while those smaller than 6mm are usually benign and monitored periodically.",
      "Can gallbladder polyps become cancerous?",
      "Most gallbladder polyps are benign. However, larger polyps (especially those over 10mm) have a higher risk of being cancerous or becoming cancerous over time, which is why they may require surgical removal.",
      "How are gallbladder polyps diagnosed?",
      "Gallbladder polyps are usually discovered during ultrasound examinations. Additional imaging tests like CT scan or MRI may be recommended for better evaluation, especially for larger polyps.",
      "What are the symptoms of gallbladder polyps?",
      "Most gallbladder polyps are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally. When symptoms occur, they may include upper right abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, or indigestion.",
      "How often should gallbladder polyps be monitored?",
      "Small polyps (less than 6mm) may be monitored every 6-12 months. Polyps between 6-10mm are usually monitored every 3-6 months. Your doctor will recommend the appropriate monitoring schedule based on your specific case.",
      "What is the treatment for gallbladder polyps?",
      "Treatment depends on the size and characteristics of the polyp. Small polyps are monitored, while larger polyps (over 10mm) or those showing rapid growth may require laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal).",
      "Is gallbladder removal safe?",
      "Yes, laparoscopic gallbladder removal is a safe and commonly performed procedure. Most people can live a normal life without a gallbladder, and the surgery has minimal complications when performed by an experienced surgeon like Dr. Kapil Agrawal.",
      "What happens after gallbladder removal?",
      "After gallbladder removal, bile flows directly from the liver to the small intestine. Most people adapt well and can resume normal activities within 1-2 weeks. Some dietary adjustments may be recommended initially.",

      "What Are CBD Stones?",
      "The common bile duct (CBD) is a small tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small intestine. This bile helps in the digestion of fats.

      "Treatment options for choledocholithiasis have advanced significantly in recent years. At Habilite Clinics, our goal is to offer safe, minimally invasive, and effective interventions that reduce hospital stays and complications. Below are the most preferred options:",
      "1. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)",
      "ERCP is an endoscopic procedure that is performed as a daycare procedure. It means that the patient can be discharged within 2 hours of the procedure. ERCP is the treatment of choice and first-line procedure for all patients suffering from bile duct stones. At Habilite Clinics, we have a team of dedicated gastroenterologists who are highly experienced in conducting this procedure. The procedure involves passing a flexible endoscope through the mouth into the intestine. The common bile duct is accessed through a small opening present in the intestine. A small cut (sphincterotomy) is made in the intestine to allow stone removal with special tools like baskets or balloons.",
      "No surgical cuts or scars",
      "Daycare / 2-3 hour discharge",
      "Stenting can be added to maintain bile flow",
      "ERCP has completely revolutionized the treatment of Common Bile Duct Stones and has minimized the risk of surgical complications associated with the bile duct stones.",
      "2. Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration (LCBDE)",
      "If the patient has gallstones and bile duct stones, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy combined with CBD exploration in a single surgery is ideal. Laparoscopic CBD exploration is also indicated in patients who have large CBD stones or in whom ERCP has failed to retrieve stones. Laparoscopic surgery involves making small incisions. A long telescopic camera and instruments are inserted to clear stones present in the bile ducts.",
      "One-time solution for gallbladder + CBD stones",
      "Preferred when ERCP fails",
      "Quick return to normal activity",
      "Minimal postoperative pain",
      "Dr. Kapil Agrawal is highly experienced and one of the best laparoscopic surgeons for the removal of common bile duct stones. He usually recommends this procedure in patients who have large CBD stones.",
      "3. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC)",
      "This procedure is usually recommended for complex or inaccessible stones. It is indicated in patients who failed ERCP attempts or who have undergone gastric bypass. During this surgery, a percutaneous (through the skin) approach is used to access the bile duct.",
      "Effective for complex cases",
      "Alternative when ERCP is not possible",

      "Rectal prolapse occurs when the last part of the intestine weakens and slips out through the anus.

      "Question",
      "What is the best treatment for pilonidal sinus?",
      "Answer",
      "The best treatment for pilonidal sinus depends upon several factors: Whether the fistula is a simple type or complex type, whether it is a recurrence or a fresh fistula, and whether there are significant branching or ramifications. Laser procedures like SiLaC and LA-EPSIT are highly effective for most cases.",
      "What are the chances of recurrence?",
      "Simple Pilonidal disease can be cured with almost zero recurrences, but in complex cases associated with multiple and extensive branching, there are chances of recurrence. Early intervention and choosing the right treatment option minimize recurrence.",
      "What is SiLaC procedure for pilonidal sinus?",
      "SiLaC (Pilonidal Sinus Laser Assisted Closure) is done for simple, single-track pilonidal disease. After cleaning and thorough irrigation of the tract, laser emitting laser fiber is inserted into the track, and a defined amount of energy is delivered, causing thermal ablation and collapse of the tract.",
      "What is LA-EPSIT procedure?",
      "Laser Assisted EPSIT Procedure uses a highly sophisticated, skinny endoscopic camera introduced into the sinus to remove all debris and small tuft of hairs under direct vision. The tract is then ablated with laser emitting radial fiber through a photocoagulation mechanism.",
      "What is the duration of stay in the hospital?",
      "We usually discharge the patients on the same day or the next day of surgery. Laser procedures typically allow same-day discharge with minimal follow-ups.",

      "What is Pilonidal Sinus?",
      "A pilonidal sinus is an abnormal tract or tunnel running underneath the skin. Also known as a pilonidal cyst or pilonidal abscess, the tract usually contains fluid, hair, abscess, and dirt. It usually occurs in the cleft at the top of the buttocks.",
      "It is a chronic inflammatory process that can result in a substantial decrease in quality of life. The treatment of pilonidal sinus is challenging because of the high chances of recurrence and delayed wound healing by conventional procedures.",
      "text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6",

This treatment has gained tremendous popularity due to its precision, reduced postoperative pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional surgical methods.",
      "The procedure has its indications, and not every patient is a candidate for laser surgery. Extremely complex fistulas, excessive branching of fistulas, and fistulas associated with abscess formation are some of the contraindications of this procedure.",

      "What is Appendix Surgery?",
      "Appendix surgery (appendectomy), is the surgical removal of the appendix. It is the most effective treatment for appendicitis, to prevent serious complications. The procedure involves removing the inflamed appendix prior it gets burst.",
      "The surgery is usually performed with general anesthesia and involves two methods—open appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy. In an open appendectomy, a single large incision is made in the lower side of the abdomen to dissect the appendix. While in laparoscopic appendectomy, there are small incisions made and the appendix is removed using a camera and long instruments.",
      "text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6",

      "What are the results of metabolic (diabetes) surgery?",
      "Metabolic surgery triggers significant weight-loss and causes remission of type 2 diabetes in nearly 80% of patients, with a further 15% experiencing major improvement. In obese patients, both standard gastric bypass and mini gastric bypass offer excellent diabetes control and long-term metabolic benefits.",
      "What is ileal transposition and how does it help?",
      "Ileal transposition is a specialized procedure for non-obese diabetic patients where a segment of the ileum is repositioned to enhance gut hormones. It increases insulin production and sensitivity, aiding rapid diabetes resolution when performed laparoscopically.",
      "Why does early surgery improve remission rates?",
      "Long-standing uncontrolled diabetes damages pancreatic beta cells irreversibly. Early metabolic surgery—ideally within five years of diagnosis—prevents extensive beta-cell loss, dramatically increasing the chances of complete diabetes remission.",
      "What is metabolic syndrome and how does surgery help?",
      "Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of central obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia—common among Indians. Bariatric and metabolic surgeries address the root hormonal and metabolic dysfunction, often curing or markedly improving every component of the syndrome.",

      "What is Bariatric Surgery?",
      "Bariatric surgery is an umbrella term that includes several types of weight-loss surgeries that help you lose weight significantly and help in getting rid of obesity-related health problems. Surgery of this type is usually resorted to when the more straightforward methods, such as diet and exercise, become ineffective or don't produce the desired results.",
      "Bariatric procedures primarily function by limiting food intake or modifying the digestive tract to prevent fat absorption.",
      "Why Dr. Kapil Agrawal is the Best Bariatric Surgeon in Delhi NCR?",
      "Dr. Kapil Agrawal is the most trusted and internationally accredited bariatric surgeon in Delhi NCR, with over 23+ years experience and over 7000 successful surgeries. He offers augmented laparoscopic and robotic bariatric surgery using the latest technology and reduced-port techniques for minimal scarring and quick recovery.",

      "How Does Bariatric Surgery Function?",
      "There are several types of weight loss surgeries, and each surgery causes weight loss in its way. Some of the standard mechanisms through which bariatric procedures induce weight loss include:",

      "Reduction in Stomach Size",
      "text-gray-700 text-sm",
      "A bariatric procedure aims to reduce food intake at a single time by reducing the size of the stomach. The stomach is usually reduced to one-third of its standard size, and this is achieved with the help of endo staplers. The feeling of fullness after eating a small meal leads to fewer calories being consumed, which leads to weight loss.",
      "Rerouting of Intestines",
      "In some bariatric surgeries, the intestines or bowel are rerouted. As a result, there is minimal fat absorption into the body, leading to weight loss.",
      "Hormonal Changes",
      "Bariatric surgery can affect the release of hormones that regulate appetite, sugar metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. For example, a sleeve gastrectomy reduces the production of hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin. As a result, appetite is suppressed. Specific bariatric procedures alter the output of various gut hormones, which helps to maintain better sugar levels, resulting in a cure for diabetes.",

      "What is the duration of stay in hospital?",
      "The type of procedure and condition of the patient typically determines the standard length of stay in the hospital. However, most patients are sent home by 24-48 hours after surgery.",
      "Can bariatric surgery cure my diabetes?",
      "Upto 95% of patients who undergo bariatric surgery see improvement or even resolution in their type 2 diabetes. How long you have had diabetes, the type of bariatric procedure used, and how accomplished your surgeon is are significant variables that can influence the results.",
      "What is the effect of bariatric surgery on pregnancy?",
      "Bariatric Surgery has significant positive effects on the pregnancy. Bariatric surgery by resolving PCOS and hormonal imbalances increases the chances of conception. It also prevents obesity-related complications like gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Bariatric surgery makes pregnancy a pleasant experience by avoiding unnecessary complications.",
      "Can bariatric surgery cure my PCOD?",
      "PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is cured in almost every patient after bariatric surgery. If you are severely obese and suffering from PCOS, you must seriously look into the option of bariatric surgery by the best bariatric surgeon.",
      "Which is better- Liposuction or Bariatric surgery?",
      "In short, liposuction is not a weight loss tool. It is a surgical technique that will remove fat beneath the skin of troubled areas, especially the abdomen or belly area. What liposuction will never do is make you lose weight, as it is a body contouring surgery that produces minimal weight loss. The only thing that makes a lasting difference in body weight is bariatric surgery.",
      "What are the chances of weight regain following bariatric surgery?",
      "If you are adherent to post-surgery lifestyle changes, eat well (even after the recommended diet stages), and exercise reasonably regularly, the chances of weight regain are almost negligible. Regular follow-up with healthcare providers, keeping yourself motivated, and following the recommendations are ways to prevent weight restoration.",
      "Do I need to stop alcohol after bariatric surgery?",
      "You must be very careful with alcohol consumption following bariatric surgery. Once you are a few months post bariatric surgery, then you can consume alcohol, but in restricted quantities. Excessive consumption can lead to nutritional deficiencies and weight gain. You must consult your surgeon, who is the best person to guide you regarding the intake of alcohol.",
      "How does bariatric surgery affect my sexual life?",
      "Bariatric surgery can dramatically have a positive impact on your sexual life. Reduced obesity levels and hormonal changes can improve libido or sexual desire. Bariatric surgery improves sexual performance by reducing weight and increasing confidence levels.",
      "Will I feel fragile and lethargic after weight loss surgery?",
      "Contrary to the popular belief of reduced stamina levels after bariatric surgery, bariatric surgery can significantly increase your staminal levels. Reduction in weight increases your stamina and energy levels dramatically, and you can easily carry out routine activities.",
      "What is Dr Kapil Agrawal's experience?",
      "Dr. Kapil Agrawal has 23+ years of experience performing weight loss surgeries and is known for providing personalized care to his patients. Every patient has reported positive experiences under his care, praising his expertise, professionalism, and compassionate approach to patient care.",
      "Will my scars be visible after weight loss surgery?",
      "Weight loss surgery is performed either laparoscopically or with robotic technology. As a result, it is almost scarless, with very tiny 3-4 incisions. We also offer single-port bariatric surgeries in selected individuals, which don't produce any visible scars.",

      "Who is Dr Kapil Agrawal?",
      "Dr Kapil Agrawal is a highly qualified laparoscopic, laser & bariatric surgeon based in Delhi with over 23 years of experience, holding credentials including MBBS, MS (Surgery), MRCS (London, U.K.), MMED (Singapore), and FMAS.",
      "What kind of treatments does Dr Kapil Agrawal specialise in?",
      "He specialises in minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robotic) surgeries and laser treatments including gallbladder and hernia surgery, advanced bariatric and metabolic surgery, anorectal laser surgeries (for piles, fistula, fissure, pilonidal sinus), single-port and robot-assisted techniques.",
      "Where does he practise / where can I consult him?",
      "Dr Agrawal is senior consultant in the Department of Laparoscopic & Bariatric Surgery at the Apollo Group of Hospitals, New Delhi, and founder of Habilite Clinics (South Delhi, Green Park & Lajpat Nagar) where he offers consultations.",
      "How do I book an appointment?",
      "You can book a consultation with Dr Agrawal via Habilite Clinics' contact number, email, or enquiry form on the website, with tele-consultations (video/online) also available in many cases.",
      "Do you accept insurance and financing (EMI) options?",
      "Yes — major health insurance cash-less facilities are supported at his affiliated hospitals, and easy EMI / payment-plans are offered for selected surgical procedures.",
      "What are the benefits of minimally invasive / laser surgery under Dr Agrawal?",
      "Minimally invasive and laser techniques offer smaller incisions, less pain, quicker recovery, minimal scarring, faster return to work and normal life — all of which Dr Agrawal emphasises in his practice.",
      "Is single-port laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery available?",
      "Yes. Dr Agrawal offers single-port laparoscopic and robot-assisted techniques for suitable cases (for example gallbladder surgery, hernia, bariatric surgery) to maximise cosmetic and recovery advantages.",
      "What kinds of weight loss / bariatric treatments are offered?",
      "He offers a full range: sleeve gastrectomy, mini gastric bypass, Roux-en-Y bypass, revisional bariatric surgery, as well as non-surgical treatments like intragastric balloons (Allurion, Spatz) plus medically supervised weight-management programmes.",
      "What should I bring / how should I prepare for the first consultation?",
      "Bring previous imaging/reports (if any), list of current medications, any existing comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension). The consultation will include clinical evaluation, discussion of treatment options, expected outcomes and costs. Prepare questions in advance about risks, recovery time, and expected results.",
      "Post-surgery care: what is the typical recovery & follow-up like?",
      "Recovery and follow-up depend on the specific procedure. Minimally invasive surgeries typically lead to shorter hospital stays, faster mobilisation and fewer complications. A follow-up plan will be provided including wound check-ups, diet and lifestyle advice, and long-term surveillance if needed.",
      "Are international patients / tele-consultations catered to?",
      "Yes — Habilite Clinics supports international patients and online consultations. Dr Agrawal and his team coordinate care, treatment planning, and post-operative follow-up for patients coming from abroad.",
      "How do I know if I need surgery or a less invasive option?",
      "During the consultation, Dr Agrawal will assess your condition (symptoms, investigations, overall health) and advise whether surgery is the best option or if a conservative, non-surgical treatment may suffice. The decision will be personalised based on your health, lifestyle, and goals.",
